## About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master's in Applied Mathematics at TU Delft. I have two years of experience as a Reporting Analyst within the risk management domain.

My academic background includes a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research and a BSc in Economics and Business Economics from Erasmus University Rotterdam. During my undergraduate studies, I focused on courses including Advanced Econometrics, Time Series Analysis, Markov Processes, and Simulation, which laid the foundation for my interest in data science and applied mathematics.

## Projects
I have uploaded the code for my Bachelor's Thesis on residual-based diagnostic tests for multivariate GARCH models, which can be found here: [BSc Thesis](https://github.com/nancygjini/BSc-Thesis)
