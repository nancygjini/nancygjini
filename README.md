## About Me
I am currently pursuing a pre-master's in Applied Mathematics at TU Delft during my full-time role as a reporting analyst in risk management, in preparation for a Master's in Applied Mathematics or Statistics.

My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Econometrics and Operations Research and another in Economic and Business Economics, both from Erasmus University Rotterdam. During my undergraduate studies, I focused on courses including Advanced Econometrics, Time Series Analysis, Markov Processes, and Simulation, which laid the foundation for my interest in data science and applied mathematics.

## Projects
I have uploaded the code for my Bachelor's Thesis on multivariate GARCH models, which can be found here: [BSc Thesis](https://github.com/nancygjini/BSc-Thesis)
